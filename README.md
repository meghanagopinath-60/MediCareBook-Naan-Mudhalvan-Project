## Setup Instructions  
To set up and run the MediCareBook application, follow these steps:
### 1. Pre-Requisites  
1. **Node.js (Version 20.x)**: Install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).
   Verify installation using:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
2. **MongoDB**: Set up MongoDB using MongoDB Compass for a local instance or create a MongoDB Atlas account for a cloud-based setup.
3. **Git**: Install Git from Git downloads for version control.
4. **npm** - Node Package Manager (comes with Node.js).
5. **Code Editor** - Visual Studio Code or another preferred IDE.

### 2. Download Project Files:
- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Place all project files in a dedicated project directory on your local machine.

### 3. Install Dependencies:
Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory (client and server side separated), and install the required dependencies by running:

1. **Server Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend 
npm install
```
2. **Client  Dependencies**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
In the server, create a `.env` file to store environment-specific variables: database connection strings and JWT secrets. The contents in the `.env` file should be as follows:
```bash
PORT=8001  
MONGO_URI=<mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret>
```

### 5. Run the Application
To start the application in development mode:
1. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
cd backend 
npm start
```
2. **Start the frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Open Your Browser**:  
   Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.
