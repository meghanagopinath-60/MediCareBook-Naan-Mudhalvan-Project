# MediCareBook Frontend

## Overview  
The frontend is structured as a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** using React. This architecture delivers an interactive user experience by dynamically loading and updating content without requiring full page reloads.  

The frontend follows a component-based structure, with each component representing specific parts of the application, such as user profiles, appointment booking forms, and doctor listings. It communicates with the backend through **RESTful APIs**, enabling seamless data exchange. Additionally, libraries such as **Ant Design** and **Bootstrap** are utilized for styling and layout, ensuring a modern and user-friendly interface.
