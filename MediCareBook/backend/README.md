# MediCareBook Backend

## Overview  
Welcome to the **MediCareBook Backend** application! This project serves as the server-side component of the MediCareBook platform, providing the necessary APIs for user management, doctor management, appointment scheduling, and notifications.  

The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, offering a **RESTful API** for the frontend and managing user authentication with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
